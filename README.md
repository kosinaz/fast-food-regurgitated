      **carrot bag**: calories, clones the next food

1. **ice cream cone**: double meal reward calories

   1. **hot dog**: main, straight flight, but shoots the sausage ahead

      **corn dog**: calories, adds a deep fried cornmeal coating to the next two main for increased calories

   1. **lemonade**: drink, straight flight but shoots a slower lemon to the upper lane

      **strawberry lemonade**: protection, every piece shoots down a pickle with a juice beam

      **curly fries**: speed, confuses and turns back the next food if missed to give a second chance

   1. **pizza**: main, straight flight, but splits into four pieces

      **quattro formaggi**: calories, every slice pulls in the next food with a cheese lasso

   1. **hot chocolate**: drink, diagonally downward flight due to the steam, leaving three drops of cream in the original lane

      **milkshake**: speed, freezes the next food to make it easier to catch

   1. **chicken nuggets**: side, wavy flight of a line of four nuggets between two lanes
